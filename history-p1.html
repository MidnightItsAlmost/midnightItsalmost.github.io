      <p id="u213539-3">I ask The Lord God to bless these words. To give me clarity, to give me wisdom, and most of all, to give me understanding.</p>

      <h1 id="u213539-7">&nbsp;</h1>
      <p id="u213539-9">Suburbs, of a large city.</p>
      <p id="u213539-10">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-12">When I was about 5 years old. Me, my older sister, mother and father (my family) lived in a 3 bedroom house. Many nights I would awake to see images of creatures, I would see them in my room. Most times in the window, one or two times in the room. My sister told me once, a short man in a top hat, he was green, and she saw him in her room. Once I when went into laundry room. I see a tiger as it laid on top of the washing machine and dryer. It looked at me and jumped through the wall that was made of bug screen. This left a large hole as I inspected it. Later, I look again in laundry room, the large hole was gone.</p>
      <p id="u213539-13">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-15">Me and my family move to a larger house a distance away. We live here until I was age 10. Always my mother and father would verbally fight each other. I learned early to be alone, as to not hear the violence.</p>
      <p id="u213539-16">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-18">I never cared much to play with other children. I would play alone. This is true for all my life, staying away from others.</p>
      <p id="u213539-19">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-21">At age 10 we move to q wooded area, far away from anything. The neighbors where 200 meters away and only to the front of our land. To the back and as far as you could walk, was forest.</p>
      <p id="u213539-22">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-24">Many times, I walk in the forest, stop and sit. I would think on the words I had heard of God. I would look at the trees and their leaves, and think, amazing. The words in my mind, God made these things.</p>
      <p id="u213539-25">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-27">When I was 12 years old I was given a horse. This house was a black Arabian. The horse had a small patch of white on his front left foot. This is an expensive horse, as I later learned in life. My father bought the horse for very little. To the former owner said it was wild. No one could ride this horse but me. I rode him at every chance I got.</p>
      <p id="u213539-28">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-30">I rode him without a saddle. I don't know why, maybe it was broken. Once he galloped refusing to stop. I slide around his neck never letting go. Still holding on to his neck and at his direct front, I fall. He runs over me, stepping on my chest, painful it was. I slowly get to my feet. The horse stops a short distance from me. The house facing me, I walk to him and I pet him. Then leaving him, I walk alone back the house.</p>
      <p id="u213539-31">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-33">I don't know when it happened, but the house became loyal to me. I could take him to different places, selling stuff for school. I did not tie him when I got off. He would wait where I left him never moving.</p>
      <p id="u213539-34">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-36">The Black Horse.</p>
      <p id="u213539-38">What an odd thing to understand, hard to believe, and even as I write this. For Jewish children at age 12 this is an important age. Almost like entering manhood. I don't know all I should about it, but it's important age. Jesus went into the Temple at age 12, He spoke to the priest, and to the rabbis. He amazed all of them with his knowledge of the Torah.</p>
      <p id="u213539-39">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-41">My mother and father fight worse now than before, never physical. My mother buys a pistol and asked me to teach her how to use it. My father tells me of things no child should hear, immoral things. This confuses me, yet I know they are wrong.</p>
      <p id="u213539-42">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-44">This fighting affects my sister. She is confused as well, and all she understands is fighting. She can not fight the confusion, so she fights me, all the time. I would be at peace, talking to no one, if I was in her presents, she would attack me, for no reason.</p>
      <p id="u213539-45">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-47">I would watch the news as a child. I learned how an Adult Speaks. The reason I did this was because my father never understood me when I would talk to him. So I talked as an adult would talk to him, hoping he would then talk to me. Talking as an adult, he would now talk to me even less.</p>
      <p id="u213539-48">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-50">I learn to stay away from my family even more. They would rarely see me. I never was loud. My mother and father now get divorced. This time is not remembered well, a haze is over my mind. I was told things I said but I do not remember them.</p>
      <p id="u213539-51">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-53">I do remember, I chose to stay with my mother and not my father. After the courts and all that haze. Me my mother live together in a small apartment.</p>
      <p id="u213539-54">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-56">I am now 13 or 14 years of age.</p>
      <p id="u213539-57">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-59">Before the divorce I went to private schools. I cheated all the way through private schools. I wanted to daydream instead learn books. I simply learned the way the school grading system worked, and made straight A's. I could not spell, barely read, and my math not that good.</p>
      <p id="u213539-60">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-62">“Hell School”</p>
      <p id="u213539-63">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-65">In private schools, boys wore Ties on Wednesdays, Plaid Pants on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I had my own desk with a little shelf and walls on three sides. I could put toys and other things in and on that desk. This environment was school for me from the start to age 14 or 15.</p>
      <p id="u213539-66">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-68">Then I am sent to a school that is 80% black (really poor), 10% Mexicans Gangs, if you know what a Gang is, 5% White Trash, and me in the remaining 5%. I get beat-up every day. There was no fighting in private schools.</p>
      <p id="u213539-69">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-71">Every morning before classes started, the kids would throw hard balls at one another on the tennis court behind the school. Once I seen a black girl crying, holding her eye in her hand, while it was still attached to her head. I stayed away from this place, I would hide most of the time.</p>
      <p id="u213539-72">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-74">I was put in classes with the disciplinary, and ignorant children. I was quiet as a mouse, frighten of so many dangers.</p>
      <p id="u213539-75">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-77">After one and one half years in this 'Hell' school, me and my mother move to a bayside city. The new school receives my records from the idiotic classes I attended. I was placed again in the &quot;Slow Learner Classes&quot;. I am still quite as a mouse, but no more am I frightened of the children. I would finish my class work within a few minutes of receiving it. While the rest of the class would struggle for the whole hour. I would just look around the class room, while sitting quietly.</p>
      <p id="u213539-78">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-80">The teachers noticed, and I was moved to higher classes, normal level. We lived here 6 months and we found a church with a large youth group. The study at that time, for the group was Spiritual Warfare. I learned about the demonic ream and more of what the Holy Spirit was.</p>
      <p id="u213539-81">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-83">Mom works for a temporary employment service, and the temporary position ended. She did get another, but for much less pay. We must now live in her deceased fathers house, with her brother. Her brother was her paternal twin.</p>
      <p id="u213539-84">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-86">One morning I awoke and walked passed my uncle's bed. He was laying on his bed with his eyes and mouth open, his left leg on the floor, his right leg on the bed, as was the reminding of his body. I check his wrist for a pulse, I check his neck artery. I wonder what to tell my mother? After a few moments, I walk into her room and simply say &quot;Your brother is dead&quot;.</p>
      <p id="u213539-87">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-89">This house had two rooms for the second floor. From the stairs my mother had the room on the right, mine was on the left. The room I slept in, had a strange feeling about it. Everyone I knew told me, that when they entered it, there was felt a strange gloom. In the closet, there was an open hole to the attic. When I would look at this dark hole, the feeling gloom was even stronger. As if it would touch my hand.</p>
      <p id="u213539-90">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-92">Form the first night and until I left this house, 90 or so days latter. I would have nightmares, so horrific, they can not be imagined, or explained fully. I Now know what they were, then I did not. I would awake in utter Fear, and Trembling.</p>
      <p id="u213539-93">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-95">I would see beings, so horrible to see, changing me, as if to kill me. After only a few nights, maybe only one night, I can't remember it was a long time ago, I remembered the things I was taught, at the church in the bayside city. So before I laid down to sleep each night, I would pray to The Lord, &quot;I Plead the Blood of Jesus Christ Over Me, My Room, and My Dreams&quot;. This earnest prayer would stop the attacks until about 3am, when the terrors would return. I would try and not go back to sleep past this time.</p>
      <p id="u213539-96">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-98">One night, unsure what time this occurred. I awoke in a calm spirit, not scared of anything. I sat up, as if nothing was wrong. I look directly at the figure, dark shadow, at the foot of my bed. Rise my arm and point saying the words &quot;Get Thee Behind Me Satan&quot;. This one and the three standing alone the right side of the bed disappear.</p>
      <p id="u213539-99">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-101">We left this house within a day of that night. As we were leaving, I opened the car door, preparing to leave, I look at window of that room. I see a figure. This figure had a long ugly face. As if it had no neck. I just looked away, get in the car and we leave.</p>
      <p id="u213539-102">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-104">My mother told me of two terrors she had. The first one was, the sound rabid dogs walking up and down the stairs at night. The next, involved an ornament I had made out of simple wood, with a hand saw. The ornament was three crosses, the center being the highest, all three atop a half moon shape, or mound. I panted the ornament brown, then wrote a scripture in red modeling paint on the mound. I covered the whole ornament with polyethylene (a strong protective). The polyethylene caused the red modeling paint to smear. The red modeling paint mixed with the brown paint making the mound look like blood. I did not intend for this to happen.</p>
      <p id="u213539-105">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-107">She tells me something came in her room one, she felt it when it enter. It throws her on the bed. It then gets on the bed with her. She at this moment looked at the ornament I made for her, as it was on the wall just above her bed. It immediately left the room.</p>
      <p id="u213539-108">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-110">My sister later tells me of a terror she had in this house. She came to visit. She lived with friends, she is around 18 years of age at this time. Sleeping on a couch down stairs. During the night something had bitten her, leaving human like teeth marks on her lower back. This was the first and last time she every visited.</p>
      <p id="u213539-111">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-113">Much latter, years, when the house is empty. A board covering the back door fell off. How? I don't know how, or I don't remember? All the over boards covering the lower windows and doors where still intact. My brother-in-law was asked to repair this board. To again cover the back door.</p>
      <p id="u213539-114">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-116">It was summer time and about 37 Celsius outside. The house had been empty a long time. He walks into the house to see if any people where inside. He tells me the temperature in the house was 5 Celsius. Then in his own words, he tells me &quot;I felt the hairs on the back my neck, stand up&quot;</p>
      <p id="u213539-117">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-119">The house burns down, some time later. No one knows why, not even the police and fire department.</p>
      <p id="u213539-120">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-122">Ten years later, I go in and out of the military, then to college, get a great job, find a slut to marry. The slut was a stupid decision.</p>
      <p id="u213539-123">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-125">Its not that I forgot God in these years. It has been my practice to pray every day, since a small child. During these ten years I have, no profound spiritual events. Like a silent time, I had always thought on His Name in reverence. I did not consult Him on a wife, I just took what came along.</p>
      <p id="u213539-126">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-128">She spent all my wealth. This I learned when the phone never stopped ringing. I never wanted to deal with the money. So I let her do it, Oh what a Stupid boy.</p>
      <p id="u213539-129">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-131">The job I had, was in medical manufacturing of many devices. I was specifically in surgical lasers. I learned to do my bosses job, and he was glad I did it for him. He could now play golf, sometimes all week. The government learned that the company was making neglectful products. I knew what they were doing, but I could not spend the money for better materials. I could not tell them to make it the way it should be made. I was told to make it the way they said, end of story. Knowing it was their way or the highway. The government was in my Bosses office this day; we all knew they were coming weeks before. He calls from his office saying &quot;I need those AES records&quot;. The government watching him ask for records that he knew did not exist. Over the phone, I reply &quot;What Records&quot; in a way as to expose his lie. He then says &quot;You know what records I'm talking about&quot;, he's right I did, of course I did, that does not mean I liked the way they cheated people.</p>
      <p id="u213539-132">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-134">I pause for a moment, knowing this is a do or die moment, are you 'In' or are you 'Out'. In an ashamed voice I say &quot;you'll will have them in about 20 minutes&quot;. They never existed I forged them, I lied to the government, many years in jail for that.</p>
      <p id="u213539-135">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-137">At this same time, a day or so, I found out &quot;I am broke&quot; (out of money). I owe everyone and the bag of gold is empty. The Idea of me lying about things that could kill a patient on an operating table, maybe they would be my family, or some else's child, son or daughter. No, I was sorry for what I did, I handed in my resignation very soon after the government's visit. By my lie the company was saved from a very large fine.</p>
      <p id="u213539-138">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-140">Before my last day came, the CEO, the top man, came to my desk to offer me more money. I say &quot;no, I can't work here anymore&quot;.</p>
      <p id="u213539-141">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213539-143">Me and my first wife lose everything. We drive a Semi Truck, transporting anything and everything. All over. I see the whole country. I have a lot of time to think while driving, it is quite. I get the Bible on audio tapes.</p>

      <p id="u213392-3">I ask The Lord God to bless these words. To give me clarity, to give me wisdom, and most of all, to give me understanding.</p>

      <p id="u213392-9">Suburbs, of a large city.</p>
      <p id="u213392-10">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-12">When I was about 5 years old. Me, my older sister, mother and father (my family) lived in a 3 bedroom house. Many nights I would awake to see images of creatures, I would see them in my room. Most times in the window, one or two times in the room. My sister told me once, a short man in a top hat, he was green, and she saw him in her room. Once I when went into laundry room. I see a tiger as it laid on top of the washing machine and dryer. It looked at me and jumped through the wall that was made of bug screen. This left a large hole as I inspected it. Later, I look again in laundry room, the large hole was gone.</p>
      <p id="u213392-13">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-15">Me and my family move to a larger house a distance away. We live here until I was age 10. Always my mother and father would verbally fight each other. I learned early to be alone, as to not hear the violence.</p>
      <p id="u213392-16">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-18">I never cared much to play with other children. I would play alone. This is true for all my life, staying away from others.</p>
      <p id="u213392-19">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-21">At age 10 we move to q wooded area, far away from anything. The neighbors where 200 meters away and only to the front of our land. To the back and as far as you could walk, was forest.</p>
      <p id="u213392-22">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-24">Many times, I walk in the forest, stop and sit. I would think on the words I had heard of God. I would look at the trees and their leaves, and think, amazing. The words in my mind, God made these things.</p>
      <p id="u213392-25">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-27">When I was 12 years old I was given a horse. This house was a black Arabian. The horse had a small patch of white on his front left foot. This is an expensive horse, as I later learned in life. My father bought the horse for very little. To the former owner said it was wild. No one could ride this horse but me. I rode him at every chance I got.</p>
      <p id="u213392-28">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-30">I rode him without a saddle. I don't know why, maybe it was broken. Once he galloped refusing to stop. I slide around his neck never letting go. Still holding on to his neck and at his direct front, I fall. He runs over me, stepping on my chest, painful it was. I slowly get to my feet. The horse stops a short distance from me. The house facing me, I walk to him and I pet him. Then leaving him, I walk alone back the house.</p>
      <p id="u213392-31">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-33">I don't know when it happened, but the house became loyal to me. I could take him to different places, selling stuff for school. I did not tie him when I got off. He would wait where I left him never moving.</p>
      <p id="u213392-34">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-36">The Black Horse.</p>
      <p id="u213392-38">What an odd thing to understand, hard to believe, and even as I write this. For Jewish children at age 12 this is an important age. Almost like entering manhood. I don't know all I should about it, but it's important age. Jesus went into the Temple at age 12, He spoke to the priest, and to the rabbis. He amazed all of them with his knowledge of the Torah.</p>
      <p id="u213392-39">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-41">My mother and father fight worse now than before, never physical. My mother buys a pistol and asked me to teach her how to use it. My father tells me of things no child should hear, immoral things. This confuses me, yet I know they are wrong.</p>
      <p id="u213392-42">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-44">This fighting affects my sister. She is confused as well, and all she understands is fighting. She can not fight the confusion, so she fights me, all the time. I would be at peace, talking to no one, if I was in her presents, she would attack me, for no reason.</p>
      <p id="u213392-45">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-47">I would watch the news as a child. I learned how an Adult Speaks. The reason I did this was because my father never understood me when I would talk to him. So I talked as an adult would talk to him, hoping he would then talk to me. Talking as an adult, he would now talk to me even less.</p>
      <p id="u213392-48">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-50">I learn to stay away from my family even more. They would rarely see me. I never was loud. My mother and father now get divorced. This time is not remembered well, a haze is over my mind. I was told things I said but I do not remember them.</p>
      <p id="u213392-51">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-53">I do remember, I chose to stay with my mother and not my father. After the courts and all that haze. Me my mother live together in a small apartment.</p>
      <p id="u213392-54">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-56">I am now 13 or 14 years of age.</p>
      <p id="u213392-57">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-59">Before the divorce I went to private schools. I cheated all the way through private schools. I wanted to daydream instead learn books. I simply learned the way the school grading system worked, and made straight A's. I could not spell, barely read, and my math not that good.</p>
      <p id="u213392-60">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-62">“Hell School”</p>
      <p id="u213392-63">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-65">In private schools, boys wore Ties on Wednesdays, Plaid Pants on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I had my own desk with a little shelf and walls on three sides. I could put toys and other things in and on that desk. This environment was school for me from the start to age 14 or 15.</p>
      <p id="u213392-66">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-68">Then I am sent to a school that is 80% black (really poor), 10% Mexicans Gangs, if you know what a Gang is, 5% White Trash, and me in the remaining 5%. I get beat-up every day. There was no fighting in private schools.</p>
      <p id="u213392-69">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-71">Every morning before classes started, the kids would throw hard balls at one another on the tennis court behind the school. Once I seen a black girl crying, holding her eye in her hand, while it was still attached to her head. I stayed away from this place, I would hide most of the time.</p>
      <p id="u213392-72">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-74">I was put in classes with the disciplinary, and ignorant children. I was quiet as a mouse, frighten of so many dangers.</p>
      <p id="u213392-75">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-77">After one and one half years in this 'Hell' school, me and my mother move to a bayside city. The new school receives my records from the idiotic classes I attended. I was placed again in the &quot;Slow Learner Classes&quot;. I am still quite as a mouse, but no more am I frightened of the children. I would finish my class work within a few minutes of receiving it. While the rest of the class would struggle for the whole hour. I would just look around the class room, while sitting quietly.</p>
      <p id="u213392-78">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-80">The teachers noticed, and I was moved to higher classes, normal level. We lived here 6 months and we found a church with a large youth group. The study at that time, for the group was Spiritual Warfare. I learned about the demonic ream and more of what the Holy Spirit was.</p>
      <p id="u213392-81">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-83">Mom works for a temporary employment service, and the temporary position ended. She did get another, but for much less pay. We must now live in her deceased fathers house, with her brother. Her brother was her paternal twin.</p>
      <p id="u213392-84">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-86">One morning I awoke and walked passed my uncle's bed. He was laying on his bed with his eyes and mouth open, his left leg on the floor, his right leg on the bed, as was the reminding of his body. I check his wrist for a pulse, I check his neck artery. I wonder what to tell my mother? After a few moments, I walk into her room and simply say &quot;Your brother is dead&quot;.</p>
      <p id="u213392-87">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-89">This house had two rooms for the second floor. From the stairs my mother had the room on the right, mine was on the left. The room I slept in, had a strange feeling about it. Everyone I knew told me, that when they entered it, there was felt a strange gloom. In the closet, there was an open hole to the attic. When I would look at this dark hole, the feeling gloom was even stronger. As if it would touch my hand.</p>
      <p id="u213392-90">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-92">Form the first night and until I left this house, 90 or so days latter. I would have nightmares, so horrific, they can not be imagined, or explained fully. I Now know what they were, then I did not. I would awake in utter Fear, and Trembling.</p>
      <p id="u213392-93">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-95">I would see beings, so horrible to see, changing me, as if to kill me. After only a few nights, maybe only one night, I can't remember it was a long time ago, I remembered the things I was taught, at the church in the bayside city. So before I laid down to sleep each night, I would pray to The Lord, &quot;I Plead the Blood of Jesus Christ Over Me, My Room, and My Dreams&quot;. This earnest prayer would stop the attacks until about 3am, when the terrors would return. I would try and not go back to sleep past this time.</p>
      <p id="u213392-96">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-98">One night, unsure what time this occurred. I awoke in a calm spirit, not scared of anything. I sat up, as if nothing was wrong. I look directly at the figure, dark shadow, at the foot of my bed. Rise my arm and point saying the words &quot;Get Thee Behind Me Satan&quot;. This one and the three standing alone the right side of the bed disappear.</p>
      <p id="u213392-99">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-101">We left this house within a day of that night. As we were leaving, I opened the car door, preparing to leave, I look at window of that room. I see a figure. This figure had a long ugly face. As if it had no neck. I just looked away, get in the car and we leave.</p>
      <p id="u213392-102">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-104">My mother told me of two terrors she had. The first one was, the sound rabid dogs walking up and down the stairs at night. The next, involved an ornament I had made out of simple wood, with a hand saw. The ornament was three crosses, the center being the highest, all three atop a half moon shape, or mound. I panted the ornament brown, then wrote a scripture in red modeling paint on the mound. I covered the whole ornament with polyethylene (a strong protective). The polyethylene caused the red modeling paint to smear. The red modeling paint mixed with the brown paint making the mound look like blood. I did not intend for this to happen.</p>
      <p id="u213392-105">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-107">She tells me something came in her room one, she felt it when it enter. It throws her on the bed. It then gets on the bed with her. She at this moment looked at the ornament I made for her, as it was on the wall just above her bed. It immediately left the room.</p>
      <p id="u213392-108">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-110">My sister later tells me of a terror she had in this house. She came to visit. She lived with friends, she is around 18 years of age at this time. Sleeping on a couch down stairs. During the night something had bitten her, leaving human like teeth marks on her lower back. This was the first and last time she every visited.</p>
      <p id="u213392-111">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-113">Much latter, years, when the house is empty. A board covering the back door fell off. How? I don't know how, or I don't remember? All the over boards covering the lower windows and doors where still intact. My brother-in-law was asked to repair this board. To again cover the back door.</p>
      <p id="u213392-114">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-116">It was summer time and about 37 Celsius outside. The house had been empty a long time. He walks into the house to see if any people where inside. He tells me the temperature in the house was 5 Celsius. Then in his own words, he tells me &quot;I felt the hairs on the back my neck, stand up&quot;</p>
      <p id="u213392-117">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-119">The house burns down, some time later. No one knows why, not even the police and fire department.</p>
      <p id="u213392-120">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-122">Ten years later, I go in and out of the military, then to college, get a great job, find a slut to marry. The slut was a stupid decision.</p>
      <p id="u213392-123">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-125">Its not that I forgot God in these years. It has been my practice to pray every day, since a small child. During these ten years I have, no profound spiritual events. Like a silent time, I had always thought on His Name in reverence. I did not consult Him on a wife, I just took what came along.</p>
      <p id="u213392-126">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-128">She spent all my wealth. This I learned when the phone never stopped ringing. I never wanted to deal with the money. So I let her do it, Oh what a Stupid boy.</p>
      <p id="u213392-129">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-131">The job I had, was in medical manufacturing of many devices. I was specifically in surgical lasers. I learned to do my bosses job, and he was glad I did it for him. He could now play golf, sometimes all week. The government learned that the company was making neglectful products. I knew what they were doing, but I could not spend the money for better materials. I could not tell them to make it the way it should be made. I was told to make it the way they said, end of story. Knowing it was their way or the highway. The government was in my Bosses office this day; we all knew they were coming weeks before. He calls from his office saying &quot;I need those AES records&quot;. The government watching him ask for records that he knew did not exist. Over the phone, I reply &quot;What Records&quot; in a way as to expose his lie. He then says &quot;You know what records I'm talking about&quot;, he's right I did, of course I did, that does not mean I liked the way they cheated people.</p>
      <p id="u213392-132">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-134">I pause for a moment, knowing this is a do or die moment, are you 'In' or are you 'Out'. In an ashamed voice I say &quot;you'll will have them in about 20 minutes&quot;. They never existed I forged them, I lied to the government, many years in jail for that.</p>
      <p id="u213392-135">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-137">At this same time, a day or so, I found out &quot;I am broke&quot; (out of money). I owe everyone and the bag of gold is empty. The Idea of me lying about things that could kill a patient on an operating table, maybe they would be my family, or some else's child, son or daughter. No, I was sorry for what I did, I handed in my resignation very soon after the government's visit. By my lie the company was saved from a very large fine.</p>
      <p id="u213392-138">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-140">Before my last day came, the CEO, the top man, came to my desk to offer me more money. I say &quot;no, I can't work here anymore&quot;.</p>
      <p id="u213392-141">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213392-143">Me and my first wife lose everything. We drive a Semi Truck, transporting anything and everything. All over. I see the whole country. I have a lot of time to think while driving, it is quite. I get the Bible on audio tapes.</p>

      <p id="u213450-10">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-12">When I was about 5 years old. Me, my older sister, mother and father (my family) lived in a 3 bedroom house. Many nights I would awake to see images of creatures, I would see them in my room. Most times in the window, one or two times in the room. My sister told me once, a short man in a top hat, he was green, and she saw him in her room. Once I when went into laundry room. I see a tiger as it laid on top of the washing machine and dryer. It looked at me and jumped through the wall that was made of bug screen. This left a large hole as I inspected it. Later, I look again in laundry room, the large hole was gone.</p>
      <p id="u213450-13">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-15">Me and my family move to a larger house a distance away. We live here until I was age 10. Always my mother and father would verbally fight each other. I learned early to be alone, as to not hear the violence.</p>
      <p id="u213450-16">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-18">I never cared much to play with other children. I would play alone. This is true for all my life, staying away from others.</p>
      <p id="u213450-19">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-21">At age 10 we move to q wooded area, far away from anything. The neighbors where 200 meters away and only to the front of our land. To the back and as far as you could walk, was forest.</p>
      <p id="u213450-22">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-24">Many times, I walk in the forest, stop and sit. I would think on the words I had heard of God. I would look at the trees and their leaves, and think, amazing. The words in my mind, God made these things.</p>
      <p id="u213450-25">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-27">When I was 12 years old I was given a horse. This house was a black Arabian. The horse had a small patch of white on his front left foot. This is an expensive horse, as I later learned in life. My father bought the horse for very little. To the former owner said it was wild. No one could ride this horse but me. I rode him at every chance I got.</p>
      <p id="u213450-28">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-30">I rode him without a saddle. I don't know why, maybe it was broken. Once he galloped refusing to stop. I slide around his neck never letting go. Still holding on to his neck and at his direct front, I fall. He runs over me, stepping on my chest, painful it was. I slowly get to my feet. The horse stops a short distance from me. The house facing me, I walk to him and I pet him. Then leaving him, I walk alone back the house.</p>
      <p id="u213450-31">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-33">I don't know when it happened, but the house became loyal to me. I could take him to different places, selling stuff for school. I did not tie him when I got off. He would wait where I left him never moving.</p>
      <p id="u213450-34">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-36">The Black Horse.</p>
      <p id="u213450-38">What an odd thing to understand, hard to believe, and even as I write this. For Jewish children at age 12 this is an important age. Almost like entering manhood. I don't know all I should about it, but it's important age. Jesus went into the Temple at age 12, He spoke to the priest, and to the rabbis. He amazed all of them with his knowledge of the Torah.</p>
      <p id="u213450-39">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-41">My mother and father fight worse now than before, never physical. My mother buys a pistol and asked me to teach her how to use it. My father tells me of things no child should hear, immoral things. This confuses me, yet I know they are wrong.</p>
      <p id="u213450-42">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-44">This fighting affects my sister. She is confused as well, and all she understands is fighting. She can not fight the confusion, so she fights me, all the time. I would be at peace, talking to no one, if I was in her presents, she would attack me, for no reason.</p>
      <p id="u213450-45">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-47">I would watch the news as a child. I learned how an Adult Speaks. The reason I did this was because my father never understood me when I would talk to him. So I talked as an adult would talk to him, hoping he would then talk to me. Talking as an adult, he would now talk to me even less.</p>
      <p id="u213450-48">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-50">I learn to stay away from my family even more. They would rarely see me. I never was loud. My mother and father now get divorced. This time is not remembered well, a haze is over my mind. I was told things I said but I do not remember them.</p>
      <p id="u213450-51">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-53">I do remember, I chose to stay with my mother and not my father. After the courts and all that haze. Me my mother live together in a small apartment.</p>
      <p id="u213450-54">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-56">I am now 13 or 14 years of age.</p>
      <p id="u213450-57">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-59">Before the divorce I went to private schools. I cheated all the way through private schools. I wanted to daydream instead learn books. I simply learned the way the school grading system worked, and made straight A's. I could not spell, barely read, and my math not that good.</p>
      <p id="u213450-60">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-62">“Hell School”</p>
      <p id="u213450-63">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-65">In private schools, boys wore Ties on Wednesdays, Plaid Pants on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I had my own desk with a little shelf and walls on three sides. I could put toys and other things in and on that desk. This environment was school for me from the start to age 14 or 15.</p>
      <p id="u213450-66">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-68">Then I am sent to a school that is 80% black (really poor), 10% Mexicans Gangs, if you know what a Gang is, 5% White Trash, and me in the remaining 5%. I get beat-up every day. There was no fighting in private schools.</p>
      <p id="u213450-69">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-71">Every morning before classes started, the kids would throw hard balls at one another on the tennis court behind the school. Once I seen a black girl crying, holding her eye in her hand, while it was still attached to her head. I stayed away from this place, I would hide most of the time.</p>
      <p id="u213450-72">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-74">I was put in classes with the disciplinary, and ignorant children. I was quiet as a mouse, frighten of so many dangers.</p>
      <p id="u213450-75">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-77">After one and one half years in this 'Hell' school, me and my mother move to a bayside city. The new school receives my records from the idiotic classes I attended. I was placed again in the &quot;Slow Learner Classes&quot;. I am still quite as a mouse, but no more am I frightened of the children. I would finish my class work within a few minutes of receiving it. While the rest of the class would struggle for the whole hour. I would just look around the class room, while sitting quietly.</p>
      <p id="u213450-78">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-80">The teachers noticed, and I was moved to higher classes, normal level. We lived here 6 months and we found a church with a large youth group. The study at that time, for the group was Spiritual Warfare. I learned about the demonic ream and more of what the Holy Spirit was.</p>
      <p id="u213450-81">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-83">Mom works for a temporary employment service, and the temporary position ended. She did get another, but for much less pay. We must now live in her deceased fathers house, with her brother. Her brother was her paternal twin.</p>
      <p id="u213450-84">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-86">One morning I awoke and walked passed my uncle's bed. He was laying on his bed with his eyes and mouth open, his left leg on the floor, his right leg on the bed, as was the reminding of his body. I check his wrist for a pulse, I check his neck artery. I wonder what to tell my mother? After a few moments, I walk into her room and simply say &quot;Your brother is dead&quot;.</p>
      <p id="u213450-87">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-89">This house had two rooms for the second floor. From the stairs my mother had the room on the right, mine was on the left. The room I slept in, had a strange feeling about it. Everyone I knew told me, that when they entered it, there was felt a strange gloom. In the closet, there was an open hole to the attic. When I would look at this dark hole, the feeling gloom was even stronger. As if it would touch my hand.</p>
      <p id="u213450-90">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-92">Form the first night and until I left this house, 90 or so days latter. I would have nightmares, so horrific, they can not be imagined, or explained fully. I Now know what they were, then I did not. I would awake in utter Fear, and Trembling.</p>
      <p id="u213450-93">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-95">I would see beings, so horrible to see, changing me, as if to kill me. After only a few nights, maybe only one night, I can't remember it was a long time ago, I remembered the things I was taught, at the church in the bayside city. So before I laid down to sleep each night, I would pray to The Lord, &quot;I Plead the Blood of Jesus Christ Over Me, My Room, and My Dreams&quot;. This earnest prayer would stop the attacks until about 3am, when the terrors would return. I would try and not go back to sleep past this time.</p>
      <p id="u213450-96">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-98">One night, unsure what time this occurred. I awoke in a calm spirit, not scared of anything. I sat up, as if nothing was wrong. I look directly at the figure, dark shadow, at the foot of my bed. Rise my arm and point saying the words &quot;Get Thee Behind Me Satan&quot;. This one and the three standing alone the right side of the bed disappear.</p>
      <p id="u213450-99">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-101">We left this house within a day of that night. As we were leaving, I opened the car door, preparing to leave, I look at window of that room. I see a figure. This figure had a long ugly face. As if it had no neck. I just looked away, get in the car and we leave.</p>
      <p id="u213450-102">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-104">My mother told me of two terrors she had. The first one was, the sound rabid dogs walking up and down the stairs at night. The next, involved an ornament I had made out of simple wood, with a hand saw. The ornament was three crosses, the center being the highest, all three atop a half moon shape, or mound. I panted the ornament brown, then wrote a scripture in red modeling paint on the mound. I covered the whole ornament with polyethylene (a strong protective). The polyethylene caused the red modeling paint to smear. The red modeling paint mixed with the brown paint making the mound look like blood. I did not intend for this to happen.</p>
      <p id="u213450-105">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-107">She tells me something came in her room one, she felt it when it enter. It throws her on the bed. It then gets on the bed with her. She at this moment looked at the ornament I made for her, as it was on the wall just above her bed. It immediately left the room.</p>
      <p id="u213450-108">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-110">My sister later tells me of a terror she had in this house. She came to visit. She lived with friends, she is around 18 years of age at this time. Sleeping on a couch down stairs. During the night something had bitten her, leaving human like teeth marks on her lower back. This was the first and last time she every visited.</p>
      <p id="u213450-111">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-113">Much latter, years, when the house is empty. A board covering the back door fell off. How? I don't know how, or I don't remember? All the over boards covering the lower windows and doors where still intact. My brother-in-law was asked to repair this board. To again cover the back door.</p>
      <p id="u213450-114">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-116">It was summer time and about 37 Celsius outside. The house had been empty a long time. He walks into the house to see if any people where inside. He tells me the temperature in the house was 5 Celsius. Then in his own words, he tells me &quot;I felt the hairs on the back my neck, stand up&quot;</p>
      <p id="u213450-117">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-119">The house burns down, some time later. No one knows why, not even the police and fire department.</p>
      <p id="u213450-120">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-122">Ten years later, I go in and out of the military, then to college, get a great job, find a slut to marry. The slut was a stupid decision.</p>
      <p id="u213450-123">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-125">Its not that I forgot God in these years. It has been my practice to pray every day, since a small child. During these ten years I have, no profound spiritual events. Like a silent time, I had always thought on His Name in reverence. I did not consult Him on a wife, I just took what came along.</p>
      <p id="u213450-126">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-128">She spent all my wealth. This I learned when the phone never stopped ringing. I never wanted to deal with the money. So I let her do it, Oh what a Stupid boy.</p>
      <p id="u213450-129">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-131">The job I had, was in medical manufacturing of many devices. I was specifically in surgical lasers. I learned to do my bosses job, and he was glad I did it for him. He could now play golf, sometimes all week. The government learned that the company was making neglectful products. I knew what they were doing, but I could not spend the money for better materials. I could not tell them to make it the way it should be made. I was told to make it the way they said, end of story. Knowing it was their way or the highway. The government was in my Bosses office this day; we all knew they were coming weeks before. He calls from his office saying &quot;I need those AES records&quot;. The government watching him ask for records that he knew did not exist. Over the phone, I reply &quot;What Records&quot; in a way as to expose his lie. He then says &quot;You know what records I'm talking about&quot;, he's right I did, of course I did, that does not mean I liked the way they cheated people.</p>
      <p id="u213450-132">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-134">I pause for a moment, knowing this is a do or die moment, are you 'In' or are you 'Out'. In an ashamed voice I say &quot;you'll will have them in about 20 minutes&quot;. They never existed I forged them, I lied to the government, many years in jail for that.</p>
      <p id="u213450-135">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-137">At this same time, a day or so, I found out &quot;I am broke&quot; (out of money). I owe everyone and the bag of gold is empty. The Idea of me lying about things that could kill a patient on an operating table, maybe they would be my family, or some else's child, son or daughter. No, I was sorry for what I did, I handed in my resignation very soon after the government's visit. By my lie the company was saved from a very large fine.</p>
      <p id="u213450-138">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-140">Before my last day came, the CEO, the top man, came to my desk to offer me more money. I say &quot;no, I can't work here anymore&quot;.</p>
      <p id="u213450-141">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u213450-143">Me and my first wife lose everything. We drive a Semi Truck, transporting anything and everything. All over. I see the whole country. I have a lot of time to think while driving, it is quite. I get the Bible on audio tapes.</p>
