      <p id="u339961-3">&quot;Part 8&quot;</p>
      <p id="u339961-4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-6">I arrive at the booking desk as the police pack my belongings. I am asked my name and other semilunar information. Never saying a word or any head motion in indicate yes or no. I am took to the maximum security unit. There were three persons of interested here in this unit. One across the small open area, and one on either side of my cell.</p>
      <p id="u339961-7">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-9">The one across the small open area, would speak in many different accents and languages. At times you would think he was Italian, French, Texan, and so on, never saying anything that made since. He had a long beard and his eyes were milky white. He was a mad man. In the cell to the left of mine, there is a man that would through his food all over his cell. This caused a great many flies. Both these men were demon possessed.</p>
      <p id="u339961-10">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-12">In the cell to my right was a young man. He had been confined because he had shot and killed a gang member. This gang member along with 3 others attempted to kill him, while he walked across a large store parking lot. I would speak to him about the Lord. He told me that he would get angry at different times for no reason. I explained that this was one of the three levels of demonic activity. These are the levers, Oppression, Obsession, and Possession.</p>
      <p id="u339961-13">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-15">Oppression, can be feelings of anger, worry, fear, and so many more. Obsession, can be money, power, lust, drugs, also the list is long. Possession, is when the person is a toy in one or more demon(s) toy box. Each demon will take that person out of their toy box and play with the person as a puppet on a string. The demon only needs a short time, but each demon that the person is possessed by wants their time.</p>
      <p id="u339961-16">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-18">I told the man in the cell to my right, that when this feeling of anger come over him to speak to the spirit. Saying, “Spirit of Anger, Leave me Alone”. Now it is not required to say “In Jesus Name”, but it always a good idea. Because the Word of God says “Resist the Devil and He will flee from you” James 4:7.</p>
      <p id="u339961-19">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-21">I am placed in this jail because of my tape recorder. The charge was to revoke my probation. I stay in this jail 41 days. Nothing was proven that I had done anything wrong. At 1800 hours I am released from this jail. There was no information given to the jail from my probation officer. I call my probation officer, there is no answer. I ask the police releasing me, where do I go? The answer, anywhere but here. I walk 13 kilometers to the halfway house, where I was refused any housing or be able to retrieve my cloths and other belongings. I leave and find a park restroom to sleep in.</p>
      <p id="u339961-22">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-24">It is about 5 degrees Celsius, and all I have is a t-shirt. I find a hand dryer in the restroom which I rig to stay on. I sat in the sink with the hand dryer blowing on me. This was not a restful night. The next day I wonder around and ask other homeless people where I could sleep the next night. I was told of a shelter not far away. I check in to the shelter. Once I lay on the bed, a real bed with a mattress. I say (out loud) to myself, “it’s been a very long time since I lay in a bed”. A shelter worker hears me and ask about my story. I explain I am ex-military and that there was a shelter for ex-military, about 160 kilometers away. The shelter buys a bus ticket for me, and I am on my way.</p>
      <p id="u339961-25">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-27">I arrive at this ex-military shelter, complete all entry papers and call my probation officer explaining I now have a place to help me to get back on my feet. My probation officer tells me I was supposed to go to another halfway house about 65 kilometers away. I ask how do I get there? The answer; “I do not care but if you do not, you go back to jail. With this answer the ex-military shelter now tells me to leave. So I am now homeless in a big city.</p>
      <p id="u339961-28">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-30">The first few weeks was the hardest. Where to find food, where to find or make a shelter. Over time I make a shelter in an area away from all the thieves and drug addicts, and manage to live as well as can be expected. Until one day where I am just sitting on a bench talking with another homeless man when the police just appear. I was dumb enough to show my official Identification. This put me in a jail some 200 kilometers.</p>
      <p id="u339961-31">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-33">This was in the dream I had on Nov 19.</p>
      <p id="u339961-35">Here in jail I send my son a letter, he then sends me one. I send another and my son sends me another, I send one more letter with no more from my son. I was told my son was very sad at this time, when he wrote to me. This part is related in my dream, when I see my son, he looks very sad in the dream. I pull him to me and we kneel to pray in my dream. I say “Dear Heavenly Father” my son repeats this, “Thank You For All You Have Given Us” my son repeats this, “We really Appreciate it”.</p>
      <p id="u339961-36">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-38">How the above relates to the dream. I sent three letters to my son. My son replied to the first two, but not to the last. Also I was told my son was very depressed that I was not there during this time.</p>
      <p id="u339961-39">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-41">I leave this jail escorted in chains hands and feet to another halfway house. This place has many homosexuals and drug addicts. Just walking around the compound you can smell drugs in the air. It took me two weeks before I was allowed to leave. I got on a bus, then once I was downtown I got off, same big city. Then I dropped all the paper work from this halfway house in the trash. Homeless is much better.</p>
      <p id="u339961-42">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-44">About an 8 months to a year later. My mother writes me an email. In the email she tells me that her car has been broken into where the passenger side windows is broken out. She explains that my sister is newly married to a man that works for an automobile “paint and body” shop, yet my sister will not help her. I also learn my sister no longer lives near my mother. My sister wants nothing but evil for me. I pack my bicycle and ride some 60 kilometers to her house.</p>
      <p id="u339961-45">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-47">I have not seen my son for a few years, and was told by my sister I was not welcome. This is why I was forces to live homeless.</p>
      <p id="u339961-48">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-50">I think first, I need a place to stay, I want to see my son, and my mother needs help. So I pack my bicycle with the simple things I need to live where I have no place to live. The distance from where I am to where I am going is 70 kilometers. I leave my homeless camp just after midnight. I arrive in the area of my mother’s house about 8 hours later. I leave my supplies at a place I once lived at, deep in the woods. I knock on my mother’s door early the next morning.</p>
      <p id="u339961-51">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-53">The following days I repair my mother’s broken car window, as well as repairing the many broken things around her house. Her next-door neighbor calls the local police and tells them I am there. They do this to receive money from the police for the information.</p>
      <p id="u339961-54">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-56">As I am bringing my few supplies from where I had placed them in the nearby woods. The police drive by me and stop. Three police officers get out of the vehicle. One is hold a M1 automatic machine gun, one walks around to my back, while the third apaches me. I am arrested and taken to jail without incident.</p>
      <p id="u339961-57">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-59">I stay in the jail 3 months before being moved to another for an additional 3 months. While at the second jail I contact my mother about staying at her house, she agrees. Although just before being released my mother sends my son to my sister. After returning to my mother’s house I try and have my son return to where I am, I miss him so. My sister now intends to file with the local government to make me pay for the support on my son. Without the resources to contend in court for my own child, my child is again out of my reach.</p>
      <p id="u339961-60">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-62">I am ordered by the local government to court to arrange my payments to my sister for my own son. I have nothing and have had no time or help to establish any way of paying anything. So I again pack my belongings and move to the streets of this same area. I first go to a local shelter, planning to stay only one night. After check in I go to a fenced in courtyard. I bring a bottle of water with me. I am told by the other residence that it was not allowed to bring water or anything to drink outside. This is crazy, so I go and ask why can’t anyone have water outside? I am forced to leave. As I am leaving a worker at this shelter follows me. When I reach the street off the shelters property, I turn and stand ready to fight, telling the worker to leave alone. He continues to threaten me. I open a small knife to protect myself, this stops his approach. I then leave the area of the shelter.</p>
      <p id="u339961-63">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-65">The worker calls the local police, which again arrest me and place me in jail. While in jail I am force to appear in court and told I must pay my sister money each month for my son. I still have no means to pay anything to my sister. My mother needs help at her home for repairs and basic living needs. She tells me she will pay my sister the money ordered by the court, and keep the house working properly. I repair the many broken things at her house, as well as cook each evening.</p>
      <p id="u339961-66">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-68">The property that my mother lives on is owned by my sister, two homes, one small and one large. My sister rents the large house and my mother lives in the smaller. The people that live in the large house stop paying my sister the rent. Connect to the local electric power legally, bring garbage, in the form of broken glass, doors, and vehicles. Leaving this garbage scattered across the property.</p>
      <p id="u339961-69">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-71">I have an aunt that lives 112 kilometers away. The aunt is in poor health and also lived alone. During the course of the next year me and my mother would travel to my aunt (my mother’s sister). I cut the grass, and also repair any broken things around her house. My aunt lives near a river which would overflow its banks from time to time. Two of the times the local government where my aunt lives would use a small boat to rescue her from her the floods. Me and my mother would pick her up and take her to my mother’s home, until the flood subsided. The second time the local government at my aunt house rescued her, they told her they would not do it again. She would have to move.</p>
      <p id="u339961-72">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-74">My sister makes a contract to sell the property to my mother and aunt. The contract is for ten years. My sister knows my aunt is not expected to live more than two years. My mother is also not expected to live ten years. In the contract my sister gets my aunts property, and my mother and aunt have to pay the amount of the rent to my sister. This gives my aunt the larger house. I am not to gain anything from the contract, although it is expected for me to move all my aunt’s belongings to the large house, which I did. It is also expected for me to repair the broken water well, broken plumbing, broken toilets, broken cabinets, broken walls, broken electrical connections, and so many more. I fix everything that was broken.</p>
      <p id="u339961-75">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-77">To Be Continued in Part 9 Leaving my country</p>
      <p id="u339961-78">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339961-80">My battle is not over, just new challenges, in ways I never expected. I can't write this next part until I have peace, the battle is too fierce.</p>

      <p id="u340078-3">&quot;Part 8&quot;</p>
      <p id="u340078-4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-6">I arrive at the booking desk as the police pack my belongings. I am asked my name and other semilunar information. Never saying a word or any head motion in indicate yes or no. I am took to the maximum security unit. There were three persons of interested here in this unit. One across the small open area, and one on either side of my cell.</p>
      <p id="u340078-7">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-9">The one across the small open area, would speak in many different accents and languages. At times you would think he was Italian, French, Texan, and so on, never saying anything that made since. He had a long beard and his eyes were milky white. He was a mad man. In the cell to the left of mine, there is a man that would through his food all over his cell. This caused a great many flies. Both these men were demon possessed.</p>
      <p id="u340078-10">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-12">In the cell to my right was a young man. He had been confined because he had shot and killed a gang member. This gang member along with 3 others attempted to kill him, while he walked across a large store parking lot. I would speak to him about the Lord. He told me that he would get angry at different times for no reason. I explained that this was one of the three levels of demonic activity. These are the levers, Oppression, Obsession, and Possession.</p>
      <p id="u340078-13">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-15">Oppression, can be feelings of anger, worry, fear, and so many more. Obsession, can be money, power, lust, drugs, also the list is long. Possession, is when the person is a toy in one or more demon(s) toy box. Each demon will take that person out of their toy box and play with the person as a puppet on a string. The demon only needs a short time, but each demon that the person is possessed by wants their time.</p>
      <p id="u340078-16">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-18">I told the man in the cell to my right, that when this feeling of anger come over him to speak to the spirit. Saying, “Spirit of Anger, Leave me Alone”. Now it is not required to say “In Jesus Name”, but it always a good idea. Because the Word of God says “Resist the Devil and He will flee from you” James 4:7.</p>
      <p id="u340078-19">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-21">I am placed in this jail because of my tape recorder. The charge was to revoke my probation. I stay in this jail 41 days. Nothing was proven that I had done anything wrong. At 1800 hours I am released from this jail. There was no information given to the jail from my probation officer. I call my probation officer, there is no answer. I ask the police releasing me, where do I go? The answer, anywhere but here. I walk 13 kilometers to the halfway house, where I was refused any housing or be able to retrieve my cloths and other belongings. I leave and find a park restroom to sleep in.</p>
      <p id="u340078-22">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-24">It is about 5 degrees Celsius, and all I have is a t-shirt. I find a hand dryer in the restroom which I rig to stay on. I sat in the sink with the hand dryer blowing on me. This was not a restful night. The next day I wonder around and ask other homeless people where I could sleep the next night. I was told of a shelter not far away. I check in to the shelter. Once I lay on the bed, a real bed with a mattress. I say (out loud) to myself, “it’s been a very long time since I lay in a bed”. A shelter worker hears me and ask about my story. I explain I am ex-military and that there was a shelter for ex-military, about 160 kilometers away. The shelter buys a bus ticket for me, and I am on my way.</p>
      <p id="u340078-25">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-27">I arrive at this ex-military shelter, complete all entry papers and call my probation officer explaining I now have a place to help me to get back on my feet. My probation officer tells me I was supposed to go to another halfway house about 65 kilometers away. I ask how do I get there? The answer; “I do not care but if you do not, you go back to jail. With this answer the ex-military shelter now tells me to leave. So I am now homeless in a big city.</p>
      <p id="u340078-28">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-30">The first few weeks was the hardest. Where to find food, where to find or make a shelter. Over time I make a shelter in an area away from all the thieves and drug addicts, and manage to live as well as can be expected. Until one day where I am just sitting on a bench talking with another homeless man when the police just appear. I was dumb enough to show my official Identification. This put me in a jail some 200 kilometers.</p>
      <p id="u340078-31">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-33">This was in the dream I had on Nov 19.</p>
      <p id="u340078-35">Here in jail I send my son a letter, he then sends me one. I send another and my son sends me another, I send one more letter with no more from my son. I was told my son was very sad at this time, when he wrote to me. This part is related in my dream, when I see my son, he looks very sad in the dream. I pull him to me and we kneel to pray in my dream. I say “Dear Heavenly Father” my son repeats this, “Thank You For All You Have Given Us” my son repeats this, “We really Appreciate it”.</p>
      <p id="u340078-36">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-38">How the above relates to the dream. I sent three letters to my son. My son replied to the first two, but not to the last. Also I was told my son was very depressed that I was not there during this time.</p>
      <p id="u340078-39">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-41">I leave this jail escorted in chains hands and feet to another halfway house. This place has many homosexuals and drug addicts. Just walking around the compound you can smell drugs in the air. It took me two weeks before I was allowed to leave. I got on a bus, then once I was downtown I got off, same big city. Then I dropped all the paper work from this halfway house in the trash. Homeless is much better.</p>
      <p id="u340078-42">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-44">About an 8 months to a year later. My mother writes me an email. In the email she tells me that her car has been broken into where the passenger side windows is broken out. She explains that my sister is newly married to a man that works for an automobile “paint and body” shop, yet my sister will not help her. I also learn my sister no longer lives near my mother. My sister wants nothing but evil for me. I pack my bicycle and ride some 60 kilometers to her house.</p>
      <p id="u340078-45">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-47">I have not seen my son for a few years, and was told by my sister I was not welcome. This is why I was forces to live homeless.</p>
      <p id="u340078-48">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-50">I think first, I need a place to stay, I want to see my son, and my mother needs help. So I pack my bicycle with the simple things I need to live where I have no place to live. The distance from where I am to where I am going is 70 kilometers. I leave my homeless camp just after midnight. I arrive in the area of my mother’s house about 8 hours later. I leave my supplies at a place I once lived at, deep in the woods. I knock on my mother’s door early the next morning.</p>
      <p id="u340078-51">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-53">The following days I repair my mother’s broken car window, as well as repairing the many broken things around her house. Her next-door neighbor calls the local police and tells them I am there. They do this to receive money from the police for the information.</p>
      <p id="u340078-54">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-56">As I am bringing my few supplies from where I had placed them in the nearby woods. The police drive by me and stop. Three police officers get out of the vehicle. One is hold a M1 automatic machine gun, one walks around to my back, while the third apaches me. I am arrested and taken to jail without incident.</p>
      <p id="u340078-57">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-59">I stay in the jail 3 months before being moved to another for an additional 3 months. While at the second jail I contact my mother about staying at her house, she agrees. Although just before being released my mother sends my son to my sister. After returning to my mother’s house I try and have my son return to where I am, I miss him so. My sister now intends to file with the local government to make me pay for the support on my son. Without the resources to contend in court for my own child, my child is again out of my reach.</p>
      <p id="u340078-60">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-62">I am ordered by the local government to court to arrange my payments to my sister for my own son. I have nothing and have had no time or help to establish any way of paying anything. So I again pack my belongings and move to the streets of this same area. I first go to a local shelter, planning to stay only one night. After check in I go to a fenced in courtyard. I bring a bottle of water with me. I am told by the other residence that it was not allowed to bring water or anything to drink outside. This is crazy, so I go and ask why can’t anyone have water outside? I am forced to leave. As I am leaving a worker at this shelter follows me. When I reach the street off the shelters property, I turn and stand ready to fight, telling the worker to leave alone. He continues to threaten me. I open a small knife to protect myself, this stops his approach. I then leave the area of the shelter.</p>
      <p id="u340078-63">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-65">The worker calls the local police, which again arrest me and place me in jail. While in jail I am force to appear in court and told I must pay my sister money each month for my son. I still have no means to pay anything to my sister. My mother needs help at her home for repairs and basic living needs. She tells me she will pay my sister the money ordered by the court, and keep the house working properly. I repair the many broken things at her house, as well as cook each evening.</p>
      <p id="u340078-66">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-68">The property that my mother lives on is owned by my sister, two homes, one small and one large. My sister rents the large house and my mother lives in the smaller. The people that live in the large house stop paying my sister the rent. Connect to the local electric power legally, bring garbage, in the form of broken glass, doors, and vehicles. Leaving this garbage scattered across the property.</p>
      <p id="u340078-69">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-71">I have an aunt that lives 112 kilometers away. The aunt is in poor health and also lived alone. During the course of the next year me and my mother would travel to my aunt (my mother’s sister). I cut the grass, and also repair any broken things around her house. My aunt lives near a river which would overflow its banks from time to time. Two of the times the local government where my aunt lives would use a small boat to rescue her from her the floods. Me and my mother would pick her up and take her to my mother’s home, until the flood subsided. The second time the local government at my aunt house rescued her, they told her they would not do it again. She would have to move.</p>
      <p id="u340078-72">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-74">My sister makes a contract to sell the property to my mother and aunt. The contract is for ten years. My sister knows my aunt is not expected to live more than two years. My mother is also not expected to live ten years. In the contract my sister gets my aunts property, and my mother and aunt have to pay the amount of the rent to my sister. This gives my aunt the larger house. I am not to gain anything from the contract, although it is expected for me to move all my aunt’s belongings to the large house, which I did. It is also expected for me to repair the broken water well, broken plumbing, broken toilets, broken cabinets, broken walls, broken electrical connections, and so many more. I fix everything that was broken.</p>
      <p id="u340078-75">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-77">To Be Continued in Part 9 Leaving my country</p>
      <p id="u340078-78">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u340078-80">My battle is not over, just new challenges, in ways I never expected. I can't write this next part until I have peace, the battle is too fierce.</p>

      <p id="u339963-3">&quot;Part 8&quot;</p>
      <p id="u339963-4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-6">I arrive at the booking desk as the police pack my belongings. I am asked my name and other semilunar information. Never saying a word or any head motion in indicate yes or no. I am took to the maximum security unit. There were three persons of interested here in this unit. One across the small open area, and one on either side of my cell.</p>
      <p id="u339963-7">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-9">The one across the small open area, would speak in many different accents and languages. At times you would think he was Italian, French, Texan, and so on, never saying anything that made since. He had a long beard and his eyes were milky white. He was a mad man. In the cell to the left of mine, there is a man that would through his food all over his cell. This caused a great many flies. Both these men were demon possessed.</p>
      <p id="u339963-10">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-12">In the cell to my right was a young man. He had been confined because he had shot and killed a gang member. This gang member along with 3 others attempted to kill him, while he walked across a large store parking lot. I would speak to him about the Lord. He told me that he would get angry at different times for no reason. I explained that this was one of the three levels of demonic activity. These are the levers, Oppression, Obsession, and Possession.</p>
      <p id="u339963-13">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-15">Oppression, can be feelings of anger, worry, fear, and so many more. Obsession, can be money, power, lust, drugs, also the list is long. Possession, is when the person is a toy in one or more demon(s) toy box. Each demon will take that person out of their toy box and play with the person as a puppet on a string. The demon only needs a short time, but each demon that the person is possessed by wants their time.</p>
      <p id="u339963-16">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-18">I told the man in the cell to my right, that when this feeling of anger come over him to speak to the spirit. Saying, “Spirit of Anger, Leave me Alone”. Now it is not required to say “In Jesus Name”, but it always a good idea. Because the Word of God says “Resist the Devil and He will flee from you” James 4:7.</p>
      <p id="u339963-19">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-21">I am placed in this jail because of my tape recorder. The charge was to revoke my probation. I stay in this jail 41 days. Nothing was proven that I had done anything wrong. At 1800 hours I am released from this jail. There was no information given to the jail from my probation officer. I call my probation officer, there is no answer. I ask the police releasing me, where do I go? The answer, anywhere but here. I walk 13 kilometers to the halfway house, where I was refused any housing or be able to retrieve my cloths and other belongings. I leave and find a park restroom to sleep in.</p>
      <p id="u339963-22">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-24">It is about 5 degrees Celsius, and all I have is a t-shirt. I find a hand dryer in the restroom which I rig to stay on. I sat in the sink with the hand dryer blowing on me. This was not a restful night. The next day I wonder around and ask other homeless people where I could sleep the next night. I was told of a shelter not far away. I check in to the shelter. Once I lay on the bed, a real bed with a mattress. I say (out loud) to myself, “it’s been a very long time since I lay in a bed”. A shelter worker hears me and ask about my story. I explain I am ex-military and that there was a shelter for ex-military, about 160 kilometers away. The shelter buys a bus ticket for me, and I am on my way.</p>
      <p id="u339963-25">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-27">I arrive at this ex-military shelter, complete all entry papers and call my probation officer explaining I now have a place to help me to get back on my feet. My probation officer tells me I was supposed to go to another halfway house about 65 kilometers away. I ask how do I get there? The answer; “I do not care but if you do not, you go back to jail. With this answer the ex-military shelter now tells me to leave. So I am now homeless in a big city.</p>
      <p id="u339963-28">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-30">The first few weeks was the hardest. Where to find food, where to find or make a shelter. Over time I make a shelter in an area away from all the thieves and drug addicts, and manage to live as well as can be expected. Until one day where I am just sitting on a bench talking with another homeless man when the police just appear. I was dumb enough to show my official Identification. This put me in a jail some 200 kilometers.</p>
      <p id="u339963-31">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-33">This was in the dream I had on Nov 19.</p>
      <p id="u339963-35">Here in jail I send my son a letter, he then sends me one. I send another and my son sends me another, I send one more letter with no more from my son. I was told my son was very sad at this time, when he wrote to me. This part is related in my dream, when I see my son, he looks very sad in the dream. I pull him to me and we kneel to pray in my dream. I say “Dear Heavenly Father” my son repeats this, “Thank You For All You Have Given Us” my son repeats this, “We really Appreciate it”.</p>
      <p id="u339963-36">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-38">How the above relates to the dream. I sent three letters to my son. My son replied to the first two, but not to the last. Also I was told my son was very depressed that I was not there during this time.</p>
      <p id="u339963-39">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-41">I leave this jail escorted in chains hands and feet to another halfway house. This place has many homosexuals and drug addicts. Just walking around the compound you can smell drugs in the air. It took me two weeks before I was allowed to leave. I got on a bus, then once I was downtown I got off, same big city. Then I dropped all the paper work from this halfway house in the trash. Homeless is much better.</p>
      <p id="u339963-42">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-44">About an 8 months to a year later. My mother writes me an email. In the email she tells me that her car has been broken into where the passenger side windows is broken out. She explains that my sister is newly married to a man that works for an automobile “paint and body” shop, yet my sister will not help her. I also learn my sister no longer lives near my mother. My sister wants nothing but evil for me. I pack my bicycle and ride some 60 kilometers to her house.</p>
      <p id="u339963-45">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-47">I have not seen my son for a few years, and was told by my sister I was not welcome. This is why I was forces to live homeless.</p>
      <p id="u339963-48">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-50">I think first, I need a place to stay, I want to see my son, and my mother needs help. So I pack my bicycle with the simple things I need to live where I have no place to live. The distance from where I am to where I am going is 70 kilometers. I leave my homeless camp just after midnight. I arrive in the area of my mother’s house about 8 hours later. I leave my supplies at a place I once lived at, deep in the woods. I knock on my mother’s door early the next morning.</p>
      <p id="u339963-51">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-53">The following days I repair my mother’s broken car window, as well as repairing the many broken things around her house. Her next-door neighbor calls the local police and tells them I am there. They do this to receive money from the police for the information.</p>
      <p id="u339963-54">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-56">As I am bringing my few supplies from where I had placed them in the nearby woods. The police drive by me and stop. Three police officers get out of the vehicle. One is hold a M1 automatic machine gun, one walks around to my back, while the third apaches me. I am arrested and taken to jail without incident.</p>
      <p id="u339963-57">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-59">I stay in the jail 3 months before being moved to another for an additional 3 months. While at the second jail I contact my mother about staying at her house, she agrees. Although just before being released my mother sends my son to my sister. After returning to my mother’s house I try and have my son return to where I am, I miss him so. My sister now intends to file with the local government to make me pay for the support on my son. Without the resources to contend in court for my own child, my child is again out of my reach.</p>
      <p id="u339963-60">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-62">I am ordered by the local government to court to arrange my payments to my sister for my own son. I have nothing and have had no time or help to establish any way of paying anything. So I again pack my belongings and move to the streets of this same area. I first go to a local shelter, planning to stay only one night. After check in I go to a fenced in courtyard. I bring a bottle of water with me. I am told by the other residence that it was not allowed to bring water or anything to drink outside. This is crazy, so I go and ask why can’t anyone have water outside? I am forced to leave. As I am leaving a worker at this shelter follows me. When I reach the street off the shelters property, I turn and stand ready to fight, telling the worker to leave alone. He continues to threaten me. I open a small knife to protect myself, this stops his approach. I then leave the area of the shelter.</p>
      <p id="u339963-63">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-65">The worker calls the local police, which again arrest me and place me in jail. While in jail I am force to appear in court and told I must pay my sister money each month for my son. I still have no means to pay anything to my sister. My mother needs help at her home for repairs and basic living needs. She tells me she will pay my sister the money ordered by the court, and keep the house working properly. I repair the many broken things at her house, as well as cook each evening.</p>
      <p id="u339963-66">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-68">The property that my mother lives on is owned by my sister, two homes, one small and one large. My sister rents the large house and my mother lives in the smaller. The people that live in the large house stop paying my sister the rent. Connect to the local electric power legally, bring garbage, in the form of broken glass, doors, and vehicles. Leaving this garbage scattered across the property.</p>
      <p id="u339963-69">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-71">I have an aunt that lives 112 kilometers away. The aunt is in poor health and also lived alone. During the course of the next year me and my mother would travel to my aunt (my mother’s sister). I cut the grass, and also repair any broken things around her house. My aunt lives near a river which would overflow its banks from time to time. Two of the times the local government where my aunt lives would use a small boat to rescue her from her the floods. Me and my mother would pick her up and take her to my mother’s home, until the flood subsided. The second time the local government at my aunt house rescued her, they told her they would not do it again. She would have to move.</p>
      <p id="u339963-72">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-74">My sister makes a contract to sell the property to my mother and aunt. The contract is for ten years. My sister knows my aunt is not expected to live more than two years. My mother is also not expected to live ten years. In the contract my sister gets my aunts property, and my mother and aunt have to pay the amount of the rent to my sister. This gives my aunt the larger house. I am not to gain anything from the contract, although it is expected for me to move all my aunt’s belongings to the large house, which I did. It is also expected for me to repair the broken water well, broken plumbing, broken toilets, broken cabinets, broken walls, broken electrical connections, and so many more. I fix everything that was broken.</p>
      <p id="u339963-75">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-77">To Be Continued in Part 9 Leaving my country</p>
      <p id="u339963-78">&nbsp;</p>
      <p id="u339963-80">My battle is not over, just new challenges, in ways I never expected. I can't write this next part until I have peace, the battle is too fierce.</p>
